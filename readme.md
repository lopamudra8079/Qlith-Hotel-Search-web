## ✅ Project Setup Instructions

### 📩 Step 1: Accept the GitHub Invitation

1. Check your **email** or **group message** for the **GitHub repo invitation**.
2. Click **“Accept Invitation”** to get access to the repository.

---

### ⬇ Step 2: Clone the Repository

Once you’ve accepted the invitation:

1. Open **VS Code** or your preferred IDE.
2. Open a new terminal and run:

bash
git clone <REPO-LINK-HERE>
`

> 🔗 The actual link will be shared in the group.

### 🌿 Step 3: Create Your Own Branch

Each team member must work on **their own branch** to avoid conflicts.

bash
cd trivigo-clone
git checkout -b <your-name-or-task>


📌 **Examples:**

* `git checkout -b rahul-search-form`
* `git checkout -b priya-booking-form`
* `git checkout -b amit-localstorage`

---

### 💻 Step 4: Start Coding

* Work on **only your assigned part** of the project (as discussed in the group).
* Keep code clean, organized, and commented for others to understand.
* Do not change or delete someone else’s code.

---

### 📤 Step 5: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Once your part is complete:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed: <brief description>"
git push origin <your-branch-name>


---

### 📢 Step 6: Notify in Group

After pushing your code:

* Send a **message in the group chat** saying:


✅ I’ve completed and pushed my part on branch <your-branch-name>.


---

### 🔀 Step 7: Wait for Merge

* Once you notify, the team lead will **review your code**.
* If everything is good, your branch will be **merged** into the main project.

✅ **Do not merge your own code. Let the reviewer handle it.**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used

* **HTML5** – Markup structure
* **CSS** – Styling & responsiveness
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM logic and localStorage

---

## 🙌 Important Notes

* **Do NOT push directly to `main` branch**
* Always **work in your own branch**
* Follow proper code practices
* Use clear commit messages (e.g., `Completed: hotel result rendering`)

---

### 💬 Need Help?

Ask in the group immediately if:

* You’re stuck or confused about your task
* You face errors while pushing or pulling code
* You’re not sure how to name your branch or file
